Things to implement:
- Random captains
- Auto captains (top two players, first pick should be a weighted flip)
- Random teams
- Auto teams (Knapsack problem, so just use brute force -- 35 options:
1234, 1235, 1236, 1237, 1238
1245, 1246, 1247, 1248, 1278
1256, 1257, 1258, 1267, 1268
1345, 1346, 1347, 1348, 1378
1356, 1357, 1358, 1367, 1368
1456, 1457, 1458, 1467, 1468
1478, 1567, 1568, 1578, 1678
)

- Track certain "clean" statistics:
  Witch crown%
  ? I don't want level/skeet here, since those can make players feel bad if they don't hit a quota per game
    eTronic suggestion: Track all SI shutdowns to remove pressure.
  ? Average speed has a similar problem, may encourage rushing too much
  FF is good, average per round.
  Weapon choice (versus time, I guess? Or percentage of map...)
  
  
  
  
- Notes about witch crowns:
  Two types of credit: Full and partial. To calculate full credit, sum all damage dealt = T, find all people who dealt > T-1000 damage.
  Example:
  A: 500
  B: 200
  C: 700
  T = 1400, so A and C get full credit.
  However, there is a circumstance where assist damage was necessary but could have been from multiple sources:
  A: 200
  B: 200
  C: 900
  T = 1300, so A and B do not get credit. One of them needed to deal damage, so we calculate S = sum of people who got full credit.
  S = 900, and we give partial credit to anyone who is â‰¥ 1000-S. In this case, A and B.
